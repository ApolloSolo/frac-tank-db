Frac Tank Measurement Application
This project was inspired by a niche process requirement. Without getting into unnecessary detail, I needed a way to have a crew of people take measurements of liquids within 6 different mobile tanks onsite. Based upon the distance from a fixed location at the top of the tank, down to the liquid, which is a mix of gas and water. 
Being able to account for the gas/water interface, I can convert that data into volume of water and volume of gas. This application fills a few roles in this process. This app quickly converts measurements into volumes, and upon submission of that data, the team has immediate have access to it. This process has increased the repeatability/accuracy in measurements using an easy-to-use interface and a reduction in transcription error potential. Actionable data arrives sooner, can be quality checked earlier, and issues rectified sooner. Also, earlier access to accurate data would indubitably lead to quicker, more confident decision making.  
This application has been deployed through Heroku and can be found here https://rocky-anchorage-78391.herokuapp.com/
